X Audio Copy

GTK and GNOME application for ripping CD-Audio and encoding in lossy and lossless audio formats.
Copyright 2010 Giorgio Franceschi

This program, written in python, was created as an interface to the excellent ripper moriruri (http://thomas.apestaart.org/morituri/trac/), the only viable alternative to Exact Audio Copy for Linux. It can extract audio from CDs, convert audio files to different formats using gstreamer and using external stand-alone encoders like lame, oggenc or flac. I also added a simple player and the ability to manipulate audio files metada.

== Dependencies ==

* python >= 2.6 (no 3.x branch)
* gtk, pygtk >= 2.16
* gstreamer, pygst >= 0.10 - multimedia framework and its python binding
* morituri >= 0.1.2 - python CD-Audio ripper (only command line)
* CDDB, DiscID (python-cddb) >= 1.4 - python module to access a CDDB-server and get information about discs
* PIL (python-imaging) >= 1.1.7 - python imaging library
* mutagen (python-mutagen) >= 1.19 - python module to handle audio metadata (ID3 tags,...)

Note - All these packages are usually available in major distributions (Ubuntu, Linux Mint), except perhaps about to morituri and mutagen

Not essential, but strongly recommended:

* lame - the best mp3 encoder (command-line version)
* oggenc - vorbis encoder
* flac - flac lossless encoder
* other command-line encoders...
